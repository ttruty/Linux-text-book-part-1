Most of the popular and functional pieces of software you use everyday invovle Free and OpenSource. Choose 2 case studies from [https://highscalability.com](https://highscalability.com "High Scalability") and write a review of the company's architecture based on these issues:  

Post your topics on the Blackboard Class Discussion board under the Chapter-02 Case Studies forum - both of your case study choices have to be unique from everyone else. Those who choose first will get the ones they want. There are over 200+ case studies there will be plenty of options.

You can find them at [https://highscalability.com/blog/category/example](http://highscalability.com/blog/category/example "Case Study Examples")  or look on the High Scalability website on the lower right hand side for the "All Time Favorites" header to find some of the more popular services.   Its best to find a company that you use or support.

Answer these questions (not all of the Answers are in each case study!)

1. What market does that company serve? (What do they do?) And have they always served that market?
1. What Operating System(s) are used?

### Lab

The objectives of this lab is to use the shell commands we learned in this chapter and understand their proper usage patterns. The outcome will be that you will be able to successfully use the Linux Shell for navigation, file creation, and file modification. Resist the temptation to use the GUI file manager and a web browser.  All actions will be done through the shell unless noted.  All work can be done on either Ubuntu 18.04 desktop or Fedora 28 desktop unless noted. 

Preface all screenshots with an H3 header indicated the question number: for example, Question 01, Question 02, and so forth.

1) Login to your Linux System. Using a package manager install the ```git``` program.  
    i) issue the command ```git --version``` and take a screenshot of the output
1) Navigate to your home directory and then to your Documents directory.  Issue the command ```git clone https://github.com/jhajek/Linux-text-book-part-1.git```  (If you have done this command previously no need to redo it).
    i) Take a screenshot of the output of the ```ls``` command.  
1) Issue the ```cd``` command to change directory into Linux-text-book-part-1.  Issue the command to display what type of file ```.git``` is.  Repeat the process for the file named ```./title/metadata.yaml```   
    i) Take a screen shot of the output of the previous commands.
1) Use the ```wget``` command to retreive a copy of the Packer.io binary for Linux.  Use this URL as the argument for ```wget```:[https://releases.hashicorp.com/packer/1.3.0/packer_1.3.0_linux_amd64.zip](https://releases.hashicorp.com/packer/1.3.0/packer_1.3.0_linux_amd64.zip "Packer") 
    i) Take a screenshot of the ```ls``` command after you have executed the previous command.
1) Use the ```unzip``` command to unzip the binary and extract the file directly to the location ```/usr/local/bin```.  **Hint:** use the ```man unzip``` command to find out the usage option in order to accomplish this.
    i) To show this was succesful take a screenshot of the output of the command ```packer -v```.
1) Use the ```wget``` command to retrieve an archived copy of the Hadoop binaries from the web.  You can use this address as an argument to your wget command: [http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.7.5/hadoop-2.7.5.tar.gz](http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.7.5/hadoop-2.7.5.tar.gz "Hadoop URL")
    i) Take a screenshot of the ```ls``` command after you have executed the previous command.
1) Use the ```tar -xvzf``` command to extract the files, we will cover ```tar``` in later chapter.  ```tar``` is the commmand ```-xvzf``` is the options and you need to provide the argument of the hadoop*.tar.gz 
        i) Take a screenshot of the output of the ```ls``` command to show the extracted hadoop directory.  
1) Find the command that is used to rename a file or directory and rename the Hadoop directory to be ust hadoop
    i) Take a screenshot of the output of the ```ls``` command.    
1) What would be the command to delete the file hadoop*.zip?
    i) Issue the command ```ls```, then type the command to remove the .tar.gz file, the type the ```ls``` command again to show it has been remove.  Take a screenshot of the combined output of all 3 directories.   
1) Using a Web Browser from your GUI, navigate to and open the file named ```chapter-05-file-path-exercise.html``` located under the directory ```./Linux-text-book-part-1-master/files/Chapter-05/images/```:  Note that the images on the web page are broken.

### Lab Chapter 7

__Objectives:__ The objective of this lab is to master vi commands and shell scripts

__Outcomes:__ At the end you will have mastered the basics of vi and now be proficient in all the tools of Linux shell scripting

*Prereqs:*  You will need to install the program ```vimtutor``` for the first part.   You can do that on Ubuntu by typing ```sudo apt-get install vim vim-runtime vim-gtk``` and on Fedora by typing ```sudo dnf install vim vim-enhanced```. 

1) To begin type the command ```vimtutor``` from the commandline. __Warning:__ ```vimtutor``` requires you to read the instructions carefully.
    i) This is a 6 part tutorial.  You need to follow all the steps of the 6 part tutorial making your changes directly in the file.
    i) __Be careful__ to save the file to an external location – otherwise IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN each time you launch the vimtutor command. You can do this by typing ```:w  ~/Documents/vimtutor.txt``` - this way you can edit the file on your local system instead of launching the vimtutor application again.  Note you need to use ```vim``` for this assignment.
1) Inside of the ```files/Chapter-07/lab``` folder using ```vim``` open ```install-java-8-openjdk.sh```.  You will be using vim to modify this file
    i)  Use the ex command to find all occurances of ```;``` and replace them with ```&&```.
    i)  Using vim commands replace all occurances of the numbers ```2.6.5``` with ```3.0.0```.
    i)  Using vim to append the packages ```python``` and ```python-dev``` to line 18.  
    i)  In the shell script,  ```install-java-8-openjdk.sh```,  using vim insert a comment above each line explaining what the commmand is doing.
1) In vim using the file ```install-java-8-openjdk-fixed.sh```,  there are numerous path, permission, and dependency errors.  Using vim, fix the shell script, give it executable permission, and have it run succesfully.   
    i) use the find command to locate tools.jar and change the path in line 9.
    i) there are directories that don't exist -- change those paths
    i) replace the references to my home directory
    i) after sourcing the ```.bashrc``` file with the command ```. ~/.bashrc```, execute the command ```hadoop version``` if version information outputs succesfully then you have succeded.
    
__Deliverable:__  

1) Push the file ```install-java-8-openjdk.sh``` in your week-07 > itmo-556 Github repo.  Submit your Github URL for your repo to Blackboard.
1) Push the file ```vimtutor.txt``` to your week-07 > itmo-556 Github repo.  Submit your Github URL for your repo to Blackboard.
1) Push the file ```install-java-8-openjdk-new.sh``` to your week-07 > itmo-556 Github repo.  Submit your Github URL for your repo to Blackboard.

### Lab

__Objectives__

This lab will allow you to create shell scripts.  Use positional parameters, control structures, and write cron jobs.

__Outcomes__

At the completion of this lab you will further your knowledge of shell scripting and enhance your abilities using Bash shell scripts.

__Notes__ 

In the Github repo provided to you please create a folder in your ITMO-556 directory named Chapter-08.  In this directory you will create a file called ReadMe.md and all of the answers, screenshots, and code will be contained in this document.  Submit to Blackboard just your Github URL.

1) What would be the command to create an array in Bash named itemARRAY?

1) Write a shell script that declares an array in Bash named dirarr. Using the mapfile command - redirect the output of the ls -l ~ command into the array previously named and echo out the 3rd and 4th elements of that array.
  
1) Write a for loop to iterate through that array and print every element of the line out on the screen.  (Make sure you detect the length of the array and use a $LENGTH variable as your sentinel condition.
  
1) Write the syntax to make a cronjob execute 5 minutes past every hour everyday to execute the shellscript you previously made to store the content of ls -l ~ into an array named dirarr.
  
1)  From the clones textbook code,  locate the file install-java8.sh located in the **files/Chapter-08/lab** directory.  Modify the script to include IF statements to check for the existance of the path ```/datapool1``` and to print an error message if the path does not exist.
  
1) Modify install-java8.sh again--this time take a positional parameter and put that in place of the directory name ```/datapoo1``` (this will allow you to customize the install location of the shell script).  
  
1) Modify the install-java8.sh from the previous question to count the number of positional parameters and if less than 1 or more than 1 stop execution of the script.
  
1) Create a directory in ```~``` named ```topsecret```.  In that directory create a file named xfile.txt.  Write a shell script to check if that file has executable permission by passing the filename as a positional paramter.  If TRUE print a message.  If FALSE print an error message that the positional parameter name of the file is not executable.
  
1) Write a shell script to check in the ~/topsecret directory to see if a given file name exists.  If TRUE print a message else print an error message with the given file name being passed.
  
1) Write a shell script to check if a given PATH is a file or a directory.  If TRUE print a message, else print an error message using the given file name.
  
1) Write a shell script that take 4 positional parameters.  In the shell script print out $0, $#, and $@ with an explanation of what these variables contain.
  
1) Repeat the previous cron command but this time redirect the standard out and standard error to a file named ~/Documents/my.log
  
1) Using awk and other tools, how would you find which ip caused the most HTTP 404 errors? Take a screenshot of the command and the output.  Use these two files in ```files/Chapter-08/logs```: u_ex150721.log, u_ex151002.log.

1) Using awk and other tools, how would you capture the top 5 offending IPs? Take a screenshot of the command and the output. Use these two files in ```files/Chapter-08/logs```: u_ex150721.log, u_ex151002.log.

1) Using sed, type the command to find the line **bind-address** located in the mariadb database server config file (you might need to install mariadb-server).  The file locations are: Fedora 28 ```/etc/my.cnf.d/mariadb-server.cnf``` and Ubuntu 16 and 18 ```/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf```.  Comment out the value, change the IP value to 0.0.0.0, and write the change back to the original file.  Take a screenshot of the command.

### Lab

Objectives

The objective of this lab are as follows:

* Understand when and how to use the sudo command
* Understand how to edit the /etc/sudoers file
* Understand how to use the journald and journalctl logging mechanism in systemd
* Understand how to add and manage user accounts
* Understand the structure and use of the cron service
* Understand how to modify, use, and secure the SSH service

Outcomes

At the outcome of this lab you will be able to successfully understand how to apply the sudo/root user paradigm.  You will understand the binary logging mechanism of journald.  You will be able to add, delete, and modify user accounts.  Finally you will be able to schedule shell scripts to execute at repeated intervals.

__Note__ Submit the answers all contained in one shellscript with a comment above stating which question the code answers
__Note__ If a command asks you to work on a user that doesn't exist it is assumed that you have to create it.
__Note__ The ```mysqldump``` application requires the ```mysql-client``` package to be installed. [http://superuser.com/questions/165582/installation-mysqldump](http://superuser.com/questions/165582/installation-mysqldump)

1)  What would be the command to add a user named "controller" to your system - using the system default values?  

1)  What would be the command to modify the user's group to add them to a *superuser* group (sudo on Ubuntu or wheel on Fedora based)?

1)  What would be the command to delete a user account named nsa-spy?  (Note you also have to include the steps to add this user... unless the NSA is already in your system =)

1)  What would be the command to edit the ```/etc/sudoers``` file and give the user "mysql-backup" sudo privilege? (Show the /etc/sudoers being edited and enter the relevant line that you add to that file)

1)  What would be the command to edit the ```/etc/sudoers``` file and give the group "mysql-admins" sudo privilege? (Show the ```/etc/sudoers``` being edited and enter the relevant line that you add to that file)

1)  What would be the command to edit the ```/etc/sudoers``` file to give the user "mysql-admin" sudo privilege to only use the mysql database backup command "mysqldump" ? (Show the ```/etc/sudoers``` being edited and enter the relevant line that you add to that file)

1)  What would be the command to edit the ```/etc/sudoers``` file to give the user "mysql-admin" sudo privilege to only execute the ```mysql``` command and not require a password?

1)  When you execute the command tail journalctl - you receive an error?  Show the error in a screenshot and explain why the error comes?

1) What would be the command to execute to find all the occurences of logs generated by SSHD in journalctl?  P.168 in the text book -- you may need to install ```openssh-server``` package if the command returns no results

1)  What would be the command to execute to find all the logs generated by _PID=1 (systemd itself) and since yesterday?

1)  What would be the command to execute to see the logs of the current boot only using journalctl?

1)  Which file and what value would I modify to change the journal's settings to make the logs be stored in memory (volatile)?

1)  The journald values SystemMaxUse= and RuntimeMaxUse= default to 10% and 15% of the system disk respectively.  How would you modify that value to be 20% and 30% respectively?  (Note you can't add percentages, you have to use your system and do some scratch math - you can execute a ```df -H``` command to see the size of your root partition)

1)  What would be the command to edit the cron service and run this command "mysqldump --xml -u root world City" (Assume you have mysql installed) at 2 am every Sunday?

1) What would be the command to edit the cron service and run this command "mysqldump --xml -u root world City" (Assume you have mysql installed) at the 1st day of every month?

1) What would be the command to edit the cron service and run this command "mysqldump --xml -u root world City" (Assume you have mysql installed) every 45 minutes?

1) What would be the command to edit the cron service and run this command "mysqldump --xml -u root world City" (Assume you have mysql installed) on every 45 minutes past the hour on Sundays?  

1) What would be the command to edit the cron service and run this command "mysqldump --xml -u root world City" (Assume you have mysql installed) at 2:45am on this coming Tuesday only?

1) What command would you use to change the group ownership of the file todo-list.txt to be owned by the "accounting" group?  (If that group doesn't exist then create it on your system)

1) What would be the command you would type to generate a RSA key pair?

1) What would be the command to transfer an RSA key pair to a remote system named logserver with the username worker?

1) What would be the command to connect via ssh using the identity logserver and connect to the non-standard port of 5555 instead of the default 22?

1) The next questions require some setup:
   i. You need two virtual mahcines for this part: One Ubuntu 16.04 and one Fedora 28 (or two comparablely different OSes, FreeBSD, Trisquel, etc etc).  
   i. You will need to modify the Network settings to **Bridged** in Virtualbox to get a public IP (if you are at home your router should suffice, if you are on campus you can come to the lab).  
   i. Install **openssh-server** on Fedora28.
   i. Clone the repository [https://github.com/arthepsy/ssh-audit](https://github.com/arthepsy/ssh-audit "SSH audit tool") to both the client and server system
   i. Run the ssh audit on the client and server, list the weak ciphers installed by default

1) Modify the client and servers using the example in the text to increase cipher strength, run the ssh-audit tool again and report any weak ciphers or security anomolies.

1) On the SSH server make the following changes to the sshd_config file and paste them at the end of the ReadMe.md file
  i. Not accept any password based authentication attempts
  i. Change the default port to be 5555
  i. Disable the value PermitRootLogin
